# PyBer Analysis with Matplotlib
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the PyBer data by city type, then create a mult-line graph of total weekly fares by city type. With this data we would make recommendations that are to be given to the higher-ups of the company.
## Results

Based on the photo above, we can clearly see that the majority of rides being done is in the urban areas. The total rides, drivers, and fares are mostly from the urban areas. Because of this, their average fare per ride and driver is smaller than the others. The lower the number of rides and drivers, the higher the averages will be. It is to be expected that urban and suburban areas will have more rides and drivers because of the high population in these areas.

The photo above also demonstrates what was expected from seeing the summary table. As we can see, the more populated the area, the higher the weekly fare totals will be. We can also see how fare totals peak around the end of February and the beginning of March, with the exception of rural areas where we see a peak in April. Apart from this, we see that through the course of these five months there are many fluctuations.

## Summary

As we can see, there is a clear disparity between each of them. This is somewhat inevitable, given that rural areas will always be less populated than urban areas. Apart from this, we can see a somewhat big increase in suburban fares during the month of April, the company should take a look at that and see what can be done with that knowledge.

We know that the lowest fares are in rural areas, we also know that it has the lowest number of drivers. There is a possibility of increasing profits if we can somehow allocate more drivers to rural areas, especially around the end of February, and the beginning of April when we see an increase in fares.

Lastly, urban areas seem to constantly fluctuate from the end of February to the beginning of April, given that urban areas are the most populated, we want to find a way to minimize this fluctuation and keep it on the higher end of the spectrum. If we can do that, we can surely increase our profits.
